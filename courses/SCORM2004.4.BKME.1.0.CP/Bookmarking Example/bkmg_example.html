      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <img class="right" src="images/be_1.jpg" alt="" /> 
      <p>The learner leaves the content to attend to other responsibilities or 
        just is done for the time being, but they do not note where they stopped. 
        When they return, the content is returned to the page they last attempted. 
        This learner-centric function is enabled by using the bookmarking concept 
        within the Sharable Content Object (SCO). The developer, by coding the 
        content to allow for bookmarking, makes it possible for the learner to 
        return back to the place last attempted, when the content is resumed.</p>
      <p>Bookmarking can be used in a variety of ways, depending upon the project 
        requirements. The premise of bookmarking is that the learner can return 
        to the content at the same location as in a last attempt. This information 
        can be used not only to return the learner to that place, but to track 
        the information in the LMS. This can then be used to determine the learner&rsquo;s 
        first and subsequent entries in the content. The uses are varied and can 
        be used in testing situations, where a learner might have more than one 
        opportunity to complete the test.</p>
      <p>By allowing the learner to re-enter the content at a previous location, 
        the content becomes more learner-centric and the flow of the content is 
        enhanced.</p>

      <h2>Data Model Elements</h2>
      <p>The data model elements - Entry, Exit and Location are used primarily 
        to implement bookmarking. The first time the learner has viewed this page, 
        the welcome banner has been initiated. On subsequent entries to the content, 
        the welcome back banner will be displayed.</p>
      <p>At this time, please exit the content by leaving this SCO and re-enter 
        to view the welcome back banner.</p>

      <h2>Entry Data Model Element</h2>
      <p>The Entry data model element (<em>cmi.entry</em>) is used to determine 
        if the learner is entering the content for the first time or if they are 
        returning from a suspended learner attempt. The determination of whether 
        or not the learner is a first time visitor can be used to customize output 
        information to the learner.</p>
      <p>The Entry data model element has three values to enable the developer 
        to determine what kind of information will be gathered. The values are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>ab-initio</em> – the learner has not accessed the SCO during the 
          current learner attempt. It is used for the first learner session, for 
          a learner attempt. For example, the developer can customize the information 
          for the first entry to the content.</li>
        <li><em>resume</em> – the learner attempt is resuming from a suspended 
          learner attempt. Data from a previous attempt is available for use. 
          A use case example would have the developer customizing the entry information 
          on subsequent entries.</li>
        <li><em>&ldquo;&rdquo; (empty characterstring)</em> – Used when information 
          cannot be obtained whether the learner is in the first attempt or has 
          previously entered the SCO and returning from a suspended attempt. This 
          value indicates that there is no information of previous access.</li>

      <h2>Exit Data Model element</h2>
      <p>The Exit data model element (<em>cmi.exit</em>) tracks information as 
        to why or how the learner left the content. There are four values that 
        can be used to describe the reason the learner exited or left the SCO. 
      <p> 
      <p>The four values are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>time-out</em> - is used if a limit on the amount of time the learner 
          is allowed in the content is reached. When that time has expired, the 
          learner attempt ends.</li>
        <li><em>suspend</em> - indicates the learner has suspended the learning 
          attempt and will return at a later time.</li>
        <li><em>normal</em> - indicates that the learner has exited the SCO normally, 
          as determined by the developer. When the learner returns to the SCO, 
          a new learner attempt is begun and a new set of run-time data will be 
          available.</li>
        <li><em>&ldquo;&rdquo; Empty characterstring</em> - This is the default 
          value of Exit data model element. This value indicates that information 
          about how or why the learner exited the SCO could not be determined.</li>

      <h2>Location Data Model Element</h2>
      <p>The Location data model element (<em>cmi.location</em>) can be used to 
        store a location in the SCO. The location could be used to allow the learner 
        to re-enter the SCO at the same point from the previous learner session.</p>
      <p>Using the Location data model element enables learners to return to previous 
        points in content after they temporarily stop the learning process. The 
        learners do not have to write down or in some other way note where they 
        were last in the content before they stop the learning process to, for 
        example, take a phone call or attend a meeting.</p>
      <p>The Location data model element allows the learner to return to the SCO 
        at the point that was &ldquo;bookmarked&rdquo; or set as the stopping 
        point. When the learners re-launch the content, the bookmarked location 
        will be the return point.</p>

      <h2>SCO Bookmarking</h2>
      <p>The use of the three data model elements - Entry, Exit, and Location 
        make SCO bookmarking possible. An example of bookmarking code is shown 
        on the next page. There are various ways to code for bookmarking, but 
        this is just an example.</p>
      <p>Navigating to the SCO is the responsibility of the LMS since it handles 
        all the sequencing aspects for the course content. The LMS stores and 
        allows the SCO to access information set in learner attempt as long as 
        the previous learner session was suspended.</p>
      <p>The learner&rsquo;s session can be suspended by the SCO setting <em>cmi.exit</em> 
        to &ldquo;suspend&rdquo; or a Suspend All Navigation Request that comes 
        from the SCO or LMS. These basic requests enable the use of bookmarking, 
        letting the learner return to a previous location after leaving the content.</p>
      <p>The SCO must also set the location of where to return. This is handled 
        by setting the <em>cmi.location</em> element to a value. This value is 
        dependent on the implementation of the SCO. There are no requirements 
        on the value of this content, other than it must be a characterstring 
        and LMSs are only required to store up to 1000 characters.</p>
      <p>Upon re-entry into the SCO (resuming a learner attempt), the SCO should 
        determine if the learner attempt is being resumed. This is done by retrieving 
        the <em>cmi.entry</em> value. If this value is set to &ldquo;resume&rdquo;, 
        then this indicates that the learner attempt is being resumed from a suspended 
        state.</p>
      <p>If the learner attempt is being resumed, then the SCO can retrieve the 
        <em>cmi.location</em> to determine where the learner left off. Once this 
        value is retrieved the SCO can use it to take the learner back to where 
        they left of in the SCO.</p>
      <p>Key Points to Remember:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>SCO should set the location (<em>cmi.location</em>). How many times 
          this is set is determined by the content creator and the design of the 
          content.</li>
        <li>SCO should provide a way to suspend the learner attempt. Suspending 
          the learner attempt is handled either by setting the <em>cmi.exit</em> 
          to &ldquo;suspend&rdquo; or issuing a Suspend All Navigation Request 
          (either from the SCO or LMS). How this is done is outside the scope 
          of SCORM.</li>
        <li>On re-entry, the SCO should check to see if the learner attempt is 
          being resumed (<em>cmi.entry</em> set to &ldquo;resume&rdquo;), then 
          retrieve the <em>cmi.location</em> value and take the learner back to 
          where they left off.</li>

      <p>This is a graphical rendering of the process of bookmarking.</p>
      <p>The learner enters the content; the SCO checks the entry state for either 
        a new learner attempt or a returning learner attempt.</p>
      <p>Depending upon the state, the learner will be directed to a new SCO or 
        a previous location that has been stored by <em>cmi.location</em>.</p>
      <p>The content is then displayed to the learner.</p>
      <p>The content state change occurs, the page is changed, interactions are 
        submitted or other changes occur.</p>
      <p>The location is then updated (<em>cmi.location</em>) to go to the new 
        place in the content.</p>
      <p>The other Data Model elements are then updated as needed, including <em>cmi.interactions</em>, 
        and <em>cmi.suspend_data</em>.</p>
      <p>The decision to be made concerning the exit of the SCO. If yes, then 
        the question is asked, is the learner attempt complete? If no, then there 
        will be a loop back to display the content to the learner.</p>
      <p>The next decision if exiting the SCO was selected, was for completion 
        of the learner’s attempt on the SCO. If the attempt was complete (yes) 
        then the SCO will set Exit Mode (<em>cmi.exit</em>) to <em>normal</em>. 
        If no, then Exit Mode will be set to <em>suspend</em>.</p>
      <p>The SCO is exited.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <img class="right" src="images/be_3.jpg" alt="" /> 
      <p>SCO bookmarking can be a dynamic and usable tool for both instructional 
        designers and content developers. By enabling it, the learner&rsquo;s 
        experience in the content is more positive by allowing re-entry to the 
        location last experienced, seamlessly, without notation.</p>
