      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <img class="right" src="images/bo_1.jpg" alt="" /> 
      <p>When learners are in a course, it is sometimes necessary to leave the 
        content. The content may be too long to complete in one sitting or other 
        situations may require the learner&rsquo;s attention.</p>
      <p>For example, if the learner has to remember where they were in the content, 
        frustration could arise if they have to navigate through content until 
        they find the place they left off. Depending on the instructional strategy, 
        the learner may be able to return to the exact location they left the 
        content. This action is enabled by using bookmarking. Bookmarking allows 
        the learner to return to their previous location in the content when they 
        re-enter the course.</p>

      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>This content example has been developed to provide content developers, 
        instructional designers and others with conceptual information and examples 
        on how to track where the learner has been in the content using bookmarking. 
        This information can be used in the design of courses. Tracking where 
        the learner has been in the content is referred to as bookmarking. Bookmarking 
        enables a more fluid content experience by making access easier from a 
        learner&rsquo;s point of view.</p>
      <p>Occasionally, there is confusion with the term bookmarking. Some confuse 
        bookmarking with favorites (a common term used in Internet browsers). 
        In certain web browsers, &ldquo;bookmarking&rdquo; is used to save Uniform 
        Resource Locator (URL) addresses into a list for later access. For example, 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Internet Explorer: Favorites</li>
        <li>Netscape: Bookmarks</li>
        <li>FireFox: Bookmarks</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM&reg;) 2004 content 
        development, bookmarking is defined as the functionality of building content 
        to allow a learner to return to a specific location if the content is 
        exited prior to completion. So in essence, this is considered a way of 
        check pointing a learner&rsquo;s progress through the content. As they 
        reach certain places in the content, the content may record where the 
        learner is.</p>

      <h2>Importance of Bookmarking</h2>
      <img class="right" src="images/bo_2.jpg" alt="" /> 
      <p>By allowing the learner to re-enter the content, without actually remembering 
        which page or set of content they had last interacted with, frustration 
        can be alleviated and the experience will be more appealing. By stopping 
        frustration, the learner will be more willing to participate and complete 
        the sections of content. Bookmarking is also important to the designer 
        and developer, allowing the learner more ease with the learning experience, 
        allowing the course to become more learner-centric and fulfilling a common 
        project requirement.</p>

      <h2>Implementation of Bookmarking</h2>
      <p>In order to implement bookmarking in content, the content developer must 
        understand what happens when bookmarking is added to the content requirements. 
        The following five things must happen in order to successfully implement 
        a bookmarking feature in content:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Navigating to the SCO is the responsibility of the LMS since it handles 
          all of the sequencing aspects for the course content. The LMS is responsible 
          for keeping track where in the course the learner left off.</li>
        <li>The SCO is responsible for keeping track of where the learner is in 
          the context of the SCO (i.e., within the SCO).</li>
        <li>The LMS allows the SCO to access information set in a learner attempt 
          as long as the previous learner session in the learner attempt was suspended.</li>
        <li>The learner&rsquo;s session can be suspended by the SCO setting cmi.exit 
          to &ldquo;suspend&rdquo; or a Suspend All Navigation Request that comes 
          from the SCO or LMS. These basic requests enable the use of bookmarking, 
          letting the learner return to a previous location after leaving the 
          content.</li>
        <li>The SCO is responsible for retrieving the location and state data 
          it stored in the LMS during the previous session and resuming the content 
          from that point. This action is a function of the SCO.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Bookmarking can be an important part to any course design and development 
        process. By using bookmarking, learners are able to enter and exit a course 
        without remembering where they last left off, creating a more seamless, 
        learner-centric experience.</p>
