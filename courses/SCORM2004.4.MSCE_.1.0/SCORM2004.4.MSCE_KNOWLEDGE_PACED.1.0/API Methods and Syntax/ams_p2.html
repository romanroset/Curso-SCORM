			<p><strong>API Methods and Syntax Overview </strong></p>
			
    <p>The purpose of API methods and syntax is session management. The API provides 
      a standardized way for Sharable Content Objects (SCOs) to communicate with 
      learning management systems (LMSs) so that a SCO can locate the API Instance 
      in a consistent manner. The standardization prevents content developers 
      from programming differently and enables content to run on various SCORM 
      conformant LMSs. How can this be accomplished? The API Instance is restricted 
      to a standard location based on the Document Object Model (DOM) hierarchy 
      and there is a common name of the API Instance to search. </p>
