			<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>
			<p>The general requirements for SCORM API methods are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>All function names are case sensitive and shall be expressed exactly as documented in SCORM</li>
				<li>All function parameters or arguments are case sensitive</li>
				<li>All data passed as parameters shall be represented as a characterstring, such as GetValue(&quot;cmi.completion_status&quot;).  While several examples throughout SCORM include return data with quotes (&quot;&quot;), the quotes are not intended to be part of the characterstring returned.  The quotes are simply used to delineate the value as a characterstring.</li>
			</ul>
