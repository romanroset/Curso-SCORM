			<p><strong>An Example</strong></p>
			<p>How does the API allow the SCO to communicate with the LMS?  Once the SCO is launched, it exchanges information with an LMS.  All communication between the API Instance and the SCO is initiated by the SCO.  In other words, the communication is initiated in one direction, from the SCO to the LMS.  For example: </p>
			<p>SetValue (&quot;cmi.objectives.0.id&quot;, &quot;objective1&quot;).</p>
			<p>It is important to note that the LMS does not invoke any functions defined by the SCO.</p>
