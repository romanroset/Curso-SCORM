<p><strong>API Overview (continued)</strong></p>
			<p>Early versions of SCORM were based on the run-time environment functionality defined in the Aviation Industry CBT (Computer-Based Training) Committee's (AICC) Guidelines for Interoperability.  The AICC has since submitted the work to the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc. (IEEE) Learning Technology Standards Committee (LTSC) with the emphasis to standardize various pieces of the Computer Managed Instruction (CMI) Guidelines for Interoperability.</p>
			<p>SCORM describes the IEEE Standard for Learning Technology - European Computer Manufactures Association (ECMA) Script API for Content to run-time services (RTS) communication as used in SCORM.  The standard describes the API for content to RTS communication.  A RTS is the software that controls the execution and delivery of learning content and that may provide services such as resource allocation, scheduling, input-output control and data management. The RTS and learning management system (LMS) are terms that are used interchangeably from a SCORM perspective.</p>
