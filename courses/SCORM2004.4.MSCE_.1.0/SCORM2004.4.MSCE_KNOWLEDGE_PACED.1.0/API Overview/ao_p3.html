<p><strong>API Overview (continued)</strong></p>
			<p>The API enables the communication of data between content and a RTS provided by a LMS through a common set of API services using the ECMAScript, also known as JavaScript, language.</p>
			<p>The use of a common API fulfills many of SCORM's high-level requirements for interoperability and reuse.  It provides a standardized way for Sharable Content Objects (SCOs) to communicate with SCORM-conformant LMSs. Since the SCO developer is not required to know all the backend coding, the API shields the particular communication implementation.</p>	
			<p>There are several terms that are used throughout SCORM:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>API - a set of defined functions that the SCO can rely on being available</li>
				<li>API Implementation - functional software that implements and exposes the functions of the API</li>
				<li>API Instance - an individual execution context and state of an API Implementation.  The API Instance represents the piece of executing software that the SCO interacts with during the SCO's operation</li>
			</ul>
