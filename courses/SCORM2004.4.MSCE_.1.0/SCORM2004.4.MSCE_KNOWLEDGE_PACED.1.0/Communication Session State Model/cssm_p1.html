			<p><strong>Communication Session State Model</strong></p>
			
    <p>The communication session state model explains the states of the Application 
      Programming Interface (API) Instance and what API Methods cause the API 
      Instance to transition between states. Each of the API Instance states defines 
      which functions a SCO may invoke. Upon completion of the content, learners 
      will be able to identify the following states in the communication session 
      state model:</p>			
              <ul>
                <li class="vocabularyContainer">Not Initialized </li>
                <li class="vocabularyContainer">Running </li>
                <li class="vocabularyContainer">Terminated</li>
          </ul>
			  <p>It is important to note that the state model is just a conceptual model used to help illustrate the intended behavior of the API functions during a typical communication session.</p>
