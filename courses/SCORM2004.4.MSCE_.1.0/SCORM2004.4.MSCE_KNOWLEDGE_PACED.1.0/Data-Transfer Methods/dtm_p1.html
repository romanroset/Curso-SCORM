<p><strong>Data-Transfer Methods</strong></p>
			<p>A Sharable Content Object (SCO) uses data-transfer methods to direct the storage and retrieval of data to be used within the current communication session.  The SCO uses these methods to transfer run-time data to and from the learning management system (LMS).  For example, the LMS can use this data to help determine completion/mastery of activities and make sequencing and navigation decisions.</p>
			
    <p>Upon completion of the content, learners will be able to identify the following 
      for each data-transfer method:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Method Syntax</li>
				<li>Description</li>
				<li>Parameter</li>
				<li>Return Value</li>
		  </ul>
