<p><strong>GetValue</strong></p>
			<p>Listed below is the syntax, description, parameter and return value for &quot;GetValue.&quot;</p>
			<p>Method Syntax: <span style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, mono ">return_value = GetValue(parameter)</span></p>
			<p>Description: This function requests information from a LMS. It permits the SCO to request information from the LMS to determine, among other things:</p>
			<ul>
              <li>Values for data model elements supported by the LMS</li>
              <li>Version of the data model supported by the LMS</li>
              <li>Whether or not specific data model elements are supported</li>
		  	</ul>
			<p>Parameter: The <span style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, mono ">parameter</span> represents the complete identification of a data model element.</p>
			<p>Return Value: The method can return one of two values. The return value shall be represented as a characterstring.</p>
			<ul>
              <li>A characterstring containing the value associated with the parameter</li>
              <li>If an error occurs, then the API Instance shall set an error code to a value specific to the error and return an empty characterstring (&quot;&quot;). The SCO may call <span style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, mono ">GetLastError()</span> to determine the type of error. More detailed information pertaining to the error may be provided by the LMS through the <span style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, mono ">GetDiagnostic()</span> function.</li>
		  	</ul>
			<p>The SCO should not rely on an empty characterstring returned from this function as being a valid value. The SCO should check to see if the error code indicates that no error was encountered. If this is the case, then the empty characterstring is a valid value returned from the LMS. If an error condition was encountered during the processing of the request, then this would be indicated by an appropriate error code.</p>
