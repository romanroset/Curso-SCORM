			<p><strong>Commit</strong></p>
			<p>Listed below and on the next page is the syntax, description, parameter and return value for <span style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, mono ">&quot;Commit.&quot;</span></p>
			<p>Method Syntax: <span style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, mono ">return_value = Commit(parameter)</span></p>
			<p>Description: This method requests forwarding to the persistent data store, any data from the SCO that may have been cached by the API Instance since the last call to <span style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, mono ">Initialize(&quot;&quot;)</span> or <span style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, mono ">Commit(&quot;&quot;)</span>, whichever occurred most recently. The LMS would then set the error code to <span style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, mono ">&quot;0&quot;</span> (no error encountered) and return <span style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, mono ">&quot;true&quot;</span>.</p>
			<p>If the API Instance does not cache values, <span style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, mono ">Commit(&quot;&quot;)</span> shall return <span style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, mono ">&quot;true&quot;</span> and set the error code to &quot; 0&quot; (no error encountered) and do no other processing.</p>
			<p>Cached data shall not be modified because of a call to the commit data method. For example, if the SCO sets the value of a data model element, then calls the commit data method, and then subsequently gets the value of the same data model element, the value returned shall be the value set in the call prior to invoking the commit data method. The <span style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, mono ">Commit(&quot;&quot;)</span> method can be used as a precautionary mechanism by the SCO. The method can be used to guarantee that data set by the SetValue() is persisted to reduce the likelihood that data is lost because the communication session is interrupted, ends abnormally or otherwise terminates prematurely prior to a call to <span style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, mono ">Terminate(&quot;&quot;)</span>.</p>
