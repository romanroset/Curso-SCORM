		<p><strong>General Error Codes</strong></p>
		<p>General Error codes describe errors that occur during the processing of API method requests. These errors are based on: </p>
		<ul>
          <li>The current state of the conceptual communication state model (ex: initialized, running, terminated, etc.) </li>
          <li>The type of API request being processed by the API Instance </li>
	  </ul>
		<p>There are 13 error conditions within General Error codes. They are: </p>
