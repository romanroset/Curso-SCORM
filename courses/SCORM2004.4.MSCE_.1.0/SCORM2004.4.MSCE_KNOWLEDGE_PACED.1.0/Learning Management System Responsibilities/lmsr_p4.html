    <p>In the chain of parents, the SCOs and assets are being launched in a structure 
      where the API Instance is in a Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) Frameset. 
      In this case, the LMS can provide the API Instance somewhere in the hierarchy 
      of parent frames within the frameset. The algorithm described in the IEEE 
      standard will search for the API by walking the &quot;chain of parents&quot; 
      either until the API Instance is found or until it reaches a point where 
      there are no other parent frames.</p>
