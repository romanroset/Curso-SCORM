    <p>In the case of opener, the SCOs and assets are being launched in a new 
      window. This new window is sometimes referred to as a &quot;pop-up&quot; 
      window that contains the SCO or asset. The LMS can provide the API Instance 
      in the opener window (e.g., the window that was responsible for launching, 
      or opening, the new window in which the SCO or asset was launched in). The 
      algorithm described in the IEEE standard will determine if the SCO was launched 
      by an opener. If so, the opener will be searched for the API Instance. </p>
