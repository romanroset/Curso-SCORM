    <p>In this case, the SCOs and assets are being launched in a new window and 
      the LMS has placed the API Instance in a parent frame of the opener window. 
      The algorithm described in the IEEE standard will determine if the SCO was 
      launched by an opener window. If so, the opener window will be searched 
      for the API Instance. If the API Instance is not found in the opener window, 
      the algorithm determines if the opener window has a parent. The algorithm 
      is designed to search the parent window hierarchy until it either finds 
      the API Instance or determines that there are no more parent windows. </p>
