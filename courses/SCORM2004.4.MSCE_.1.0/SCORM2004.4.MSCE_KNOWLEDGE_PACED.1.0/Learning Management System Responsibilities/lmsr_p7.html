	<p><strong>Version Attribute</strong></p>
			
    <p>The IEEE standard requires that the API Instance be accessible through 
      a DOM Object. The standard also requires the DOM object to have an attribute 
      named version. The value of the attribute represents the version of the 
      API Instance. The value assigned to the attribute is required to consist 
      of a period-delimited string containing major and minor release values as 
      whole numbers. To indicate that the API Instance is built in conformance 
      with the IEEE Standard, the first three characters are required to be &quot;1.0&quot;. 
      If an implementation wants to add additional characters to the value, to 
      represent internal versioning information, then the fourth character is 
      required to be another period-delimiter. An example would be &quot;1.0.&quot;, 
      with a period following the zero.</p>
