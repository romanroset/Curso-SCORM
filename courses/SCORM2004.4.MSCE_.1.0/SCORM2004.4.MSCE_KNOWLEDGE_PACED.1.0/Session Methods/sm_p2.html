			<p>Listed below is the syntax, description, parameter and return value for &quot;initialize.&quot;</p>
			<p>Method Syntax: <span style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, mono ">return_value = Initialize(parameter)</span></p>
			<p>Description: This function is used to initiate the communication session. It allows the learning management system (LMS) to handle LMS specific initialization issues. </p>
			<p>Parameter: (&quot;&quot;) &ndash; empty characterstring. An empty characterstring shall be passed as a parameter.</p>
			<p>Return Value: The function can return one of two values. The return value shall be represented as a characterstring. The quotes (&quot;&quot;) are not part of the characterstring returned, they are used purely to delineate the values returned.</p>
			<ul>
              <li>&quot;<span style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, mono ">true</span>&quot; &ndash; The characterstring &quot;<span style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, mono ">true</span>&quot; shall be returned if communication session initialization, as determined by the LMS, was successful.</li>
			  <li>&quot;<span style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, mono ">false</span>&quot; &ndash; The characterstring &quot;<span style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, mono ">false</span>&quot; shall be returned if communication session initialization, as determined by the LMS, was unsuccessful. The API Instance shall set the error code to a value specific to the error encountered. The SCO may call <span style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, mono ">GetLastError()</span> to determine the type of error. More detailed information pertaining to the error may be provided by the LMS through the <span style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, mono ">GetDiagnostic()</span> function.</li>
