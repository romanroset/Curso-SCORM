				<p><strong>Terminate</strong></p>
			<p>Listed below is the syntax, description, parameter and return value for &quot;terminate.&quot;</p>
			<p>Method Syntax: <span style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, mono ">return_value = Terminate(parameter)</span></p>
			<p>Description: This function is used to terminate the communication session. It is used by the SCO when the SCO has determined that it no longer needs to communicate with the LMS. The <span style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, mono ">Terminate()</span> function also shall cause the persistence of any data (e.g., an implicit <span style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, mono ">Commit(&quot;&quot;)</span> call) set by the SCO since the last successful call to <span style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, mono ">Initialize(&quot;&quot;)</span> or <span style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, mono ">Commit(&quot;&quot;)</span>, whichever occurred most recently. This guarantees to the SCO that all data set by the SCO has been persisted by the LMS.</p>
			
    <p>Once the communication session has been successfully terminated, the SCO 
      is only permitted to call the support methods.</p>
			<p>Parameter: (&quot;&quot;) &ndash; empty characterstring. An empty characterstring shall be passed as a parameter.</p>
			<p>Return Value: The method can return one of two values. The return value shall be represented as a characterstring. The quotes (&quot;&quot;) are not part of the characterstring returned, they are used purely to delineate the values returned.</p>
			<ul>
              <li>&quot;<span style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, mono ">true</span>&quot; &ndash; The characterstring &quot; true&quot; shall be returned if termination of the communication session, as determined by the LMS, was successful.</li>
		      <li>&quot;<span style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, mono ">false</span>&quot; &ndash; The characterstring &quot; false &quot; shall be returned if termination of the communication session, as determined by the LMS, was unsuccessful. The API Instance shall set the error code to a value specific to the error encountered. The SCO may call <span style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, mono ">GetLastError()</span> to determine the type of error. More detailed information pertaining to the error may be provided by the LMS through the <span style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, mono ">GetDiagnostic()</span> function.</li>
