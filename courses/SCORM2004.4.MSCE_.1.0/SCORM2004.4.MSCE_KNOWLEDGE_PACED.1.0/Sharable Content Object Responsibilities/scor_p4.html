			<p><strong>SCO Responsibilities</strong></p>
			<p>It is important that the SCO must look in the following locations and in the order specified for the API Instance: </p>
			<ul>
			  	<li>The chain of parents of the current window, until the top of the window of the parent chain is reached </li>
			  	<li>The opener window </li>
				<li>The chain of parents of the opener window, until the top window of the parent chain is reached </li>
		  	</ul>
			<p>The SCO must search for the API Instance in this way and will stop as soon as an API instance is found. For the SCO to know what it is looking for, the IEEE standard has also defined a mandatory name for the object in the DOM that is associated with the API Implementation. The name for the API Implementation is &quot;API_1484_11&quot;. </p>
			<p>Once a SCO finds an API Instance, the SCO is required to, at a minimum, issue <span style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, mono ">Initialize(&quot;&quot;)</span> and <span style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, mono ">Terminate(&quot;&quot;)</span> API calls. </p>
			<p>The IEEE standard has provided a simple piece of JavaScript that will find the API Instance in a consistent manner but it is not a requirement to use this code. Other variations can also be written.</p>
