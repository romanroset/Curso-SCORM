<p><strong>Support Methods</strong></p>
			
    <p>Support methods exist within the Application Programming Interface (API) 
      to allow a Sharable Content Object (SCO) to determine error handling and 
      diagnostic information. Error conditions may occur with each API function 
      described so far. When these error conditions are encountered, the error 
      code is changed to indicate the error encountered. The calls to support 
      methods do not affect the error state. In other words, calling any of the 
      support methods shall not change the current error code. These support methods 
      allow the SCO to determine if an error occurred and how to handle any error 
      conditions encountered.</p>
			
    <p>Upon completion of the content, learners will be able to identify the following 
      for each support method:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Method Syntax</li>
				<li>Description</li>
				<li>Parameter</li>
				<li>Return Value</li>
		  </ul>
