      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>If <em>Sequencing Control Choice</em> is set to <code>True</code>, any 
        child activities are allowed to be navigated to by the learner. But there 
        are times when the instructional designer has determined that the learner 
        should not be able to navigate to certain child activities due to instructional 
        aspects of the content. This could be an activity that must be completed 
        before another activity is started or an assessment activity that must 
        only be completed after the content has been completed. The content developer 
        has the ability to restrict the child activities by use of <em>Constrained 
        Choice Controls.</em></p>

      <h2>Constrained Choice</h2>
      <p><em>Constrained Choice</em> allows the instructional designer and the 
        content developer to limit how the choice navigation requests are applied 
        to the content and the processing of sequencing requests.</p>

      <h2>Constrained Choice</h2>
      <p><em>Constrained Choice</em> is used when the instructional sequencing 
        design determines that only the previous and next child activities will 
        be allowed. <em>Constrained Choice</em> limits the learner from jumping 
        too far in the content and keeps them in the logical flow.</p>
      <p>In this example, the sequencing strategy for the learner is to attempt 
        Activity B, Activity 4, Activity 5 and Activity C. If the learner chooses 
        Activity B, then a constrained choice rule is adhered to. The learner 
        must complete the child activities (Activity 1, Activity 2, Activity 3) 
        before attempting other activities. They are constrained from choosing 
        other activities in the tree.</p>
      <p>Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM&reg;) does not define 
        any requirements for the learning management system (LMS) user interface. 
        The user interface for LMSs may vary.</p>

      <h2>Prevent Activation</h2>
      <p>The <em>Prevent Activation</em> element being set to <code>True</code> 
        indicates that an attempt on any descendent activity can not begin until 
        the affected activity has been reached &ndash; it is either active or 
        has become the current activity. This limits the learner from selecting, 
        through a <em>Choice</em> navigation request, the descendent activities 
        before the affected activity has been reached by the learner.</p>
      <p>In the example shown, the instructional designer has determined that 
        the learner must reach Activity C before they are allowed to choose Activity 
        3, 4 or 5.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>The <em>Constrained Choice Control</em> modes allow the Content Developer 
        to interpret the intentions of the Instructional Designer by implementing 
        the constraints on the content. By using <em>Constrained Choice</em> and 
        <em>Prevent Activation</em>, the learner will be restricted to the areas 
        of content the Instructional Designer has determined. The learner will 
        still have a choice of which content they wish to participate in, but 
        will be restricted to completion of certain aspects of the content before 
        navigating to other sections.</p>
