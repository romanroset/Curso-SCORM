      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Welcome to the Sequencing Essentials Content Example (SECE). This example 
        was created to build foundational knowledge on the key concepts that apply 
        to Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM&reg;) 2004 Sequencing. 
        General information about sequencing is contained in this content example 
        to aid in the development of SCORM 2004 content. A linear 
        sequencing strategy was used in the creation of this content example. 
        This means that the navigation throughout this content will move from 
        section to section in a defined order:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sequencing Overview</li>
        <li>Tracking Model</li>
        <li>Sequencing Control Modes</li>
        <li>Constrained Choice</li>
        <li>Sequencing Rule Description</li>
        <li>Limit Conditions</li>
        <li>Rollup Rule Description</li>
        <li>Rollup Behavior</li>
        <li>Objective Description</li>
		<li>Sequencing Objectives</li>
		
      </ul>
      <p>To navigate through the content, use the next and back arrows located 
        at the bottom right of the interface. You can also move through the content 
        by clicking the topics in the table of contents. The source 
        code can be viewed at any time by right clicking the content on the screen. 
        More detailed information on SCORM Sequencing can be found in the SCORM 
        Sequencing and Navigation book at <a href="http://www.adlnet.gov" target="_blank">www.adlnet.gov</a>.</p>
