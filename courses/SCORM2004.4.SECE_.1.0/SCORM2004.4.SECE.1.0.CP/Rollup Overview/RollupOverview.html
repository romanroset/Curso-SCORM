      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>An attempt on an activity always occurs within the context of an attempt 
        on its ancestors. If you are reading a sentence in a book, you are also:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reading a paragraph</li>
        <li>Reading a page</li>
        <li>Reading a chapter</li>
        <li>Reading the book </li>
      </ul>
      <p>As a learner progresses through a series of content objects, those content 
        objects may report status; therefore, the status of the parent activity 
        is dependent on the status of its children activities.</p>

      <h2>Rollup</h2>
      <p>Rollup is the process of determining a cluster activity&rsquo;s status 
        information based on its children&rsquo;s status information. Learners 
        do not directly interact with a cluster; therefore, rollup is the only 
        mechanism for the status of a cluster to be determined. The image below 
        shows that Activity A&rsquo;s status information is rolled up from its 
        children, Activity 1, Activity 2 and Activity 3. The status shown for 
        Activity A is the &ldquo;after rollup&rdquo; status. It is the status 
        that resulted from measure rollup.</p>

      <h2>Rollup Measure</h2>
      <p>Measure (score) always rolls up, if it exists (is not &ldquo;<code>unknown</code>&rdquo;) 
        for any child. Content developers can &lsquo;turn off&rsquo; a measure, 
        at any level, by setting its weight to zero. By default, measure does 
        not affect satisfaction status; however, a Minimum Objective Measure may 
        be applied.</p>
      <p>If a Minimum Objective Measure is applied, the activity&rsquo;s measure 
        will be evaluated against a threshold to determine the activity&rsquo;s 
        satisfaction status.</p>

      <h2>Rolling Incomplete Information</h2>
      <p>In some cases, rollup will not be able to determine an activity&rsquo;s 
        status if some child activity has an &ldquo;<code>unknown</code>&rdquo; status. Also, 
        by default, <em>Suspended</em> activities <strong>DO</strong> contribute 
        to rollup, which is not always the desired result &mdash; this can result 
        in premature success and failure.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>In general, rollup is used to provide a form of feedback about the learner&rsquo;s 
        experience through an activity by looking at the sum of an activity&rsquo;s 
        parts. Therefore, the idea of rollup is to simply sum up the parts of 
        a cluster.</p>
