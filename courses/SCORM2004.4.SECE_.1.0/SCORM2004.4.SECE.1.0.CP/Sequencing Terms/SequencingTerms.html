      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>In order to understand Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM&reg;) 
        Sequencing there are some key terms that you must first know:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Learning Activity</li>
        <li>Cluster</li>
        <li>Leaf</li>
        <li>Activity Tree</li>

      <h2>Learning Activity</h2>
      <img class="right" src="images/st3.jpg" alt="" /> 
      <p>A learning activity is defined as a meaningful unit of instruction. A 
        learning activity can be a module, lesson, etc. Learning activities can 
        also consist of sub-activities such as a pre-test or post-test.</p>

				id="swf4"

      <p>A cluster is a specialized form of a learning activity that has sub-activities. 
        Clusters consist of a single parent activity and its immediate children, 
        but not the descendents of its children. Clusters are considered the basic 
        building blocks of an activity tree. The parent activity in a cluster 
        describes the sequencing strategy for that cluster.</p>

      <p>The children of a cluster are either leaf activities or other clusters. 
        The sequencing strategy will define how content objects of leaf activities 
        (non-cluster children) are delivered. Along with clusters, a leaf is considered 
        a basic building block of an activity tree.</p>

      <h2>Activity Tree</h2>
      <p>Activity trees are used in SCORM to describe how learning activities 
        are structured. These are the main components of sequencing. Together 
        the learning activities, clusters and leaves all make up what is known 
        as the activity tree and from this tree the sequencing is developed.</p>
