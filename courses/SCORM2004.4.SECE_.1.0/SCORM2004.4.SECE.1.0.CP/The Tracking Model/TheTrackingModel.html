      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Each learning activity in the activity tree has a collection of sequencing 
        state information associated with it for each learner. This sequencing 
        state information is called the sequencing tracking model.</p>
      <p>The purpose of the sequencing tracking model is to capture information 
        gathered from the learner&rsquo;s interaction with the content objects 
        associated with learning activities.</p>

      <h2>How the Tracking Model Relates to the Run-Time Data Model</h2>
      <p>The sequencing tracking model is related to the SCORM Run-Time Data Model. 
        It all ties together in that the run-time data model tracks an individual 
        learner's experience within a Sharable Content Object (SCO). The sequencing 
        tracking model in turn relies on portions of the SCO's tracked information 
        and relates that information to the activity tree. This informs the learning 
        management system (LMS) with certain pieces of information that might 
        be used to evaluate sequencing decisions.</p>

      <h2>Primary and Non-Primary Objectives</h2>
      <p>Every activity defined in the activity tree may have one or more objectives. 
        Each activity in the activity tree has a primary objective. A primary 
        objective is explicitly defined by using the <code>primaryObjective</code> 
        element. If an objective is not defined explicitly, then one is assigned 
        by default.</p>
      <p>If the activity has multiple objectives, one must be defined as the primary 
        objective. The primary objective is the objective that is used by the 
        sequencing engines to help determine status of the parent activities (i.e. 
        through the rollup process). All of the other defined objectives do not 
        contribute to the rollup process.</p>

      <h2>Tracking Status Information</h2>

            <p>Objective Progress Information describes the learner&rsquo;s progress

              a learning activity can have more than one objective associated 
              with it.</p>

        <li>The SCO&rsquo;s &ldquo;<code>cmi.score.scaled</code>&rdquo; value affects the current

      <h2>Global vs. Local Objectives</h2>
      <img class="right" src="images/tm8.jpg" alt="" /> 
      <p>Each activity has its own set of learning objectives defined for it called 
        &ldquo;local&rdquo; objectives. Each activity has these by default, no 
        explicit association to objectives is needed. The content developer can 
        associate objectives to activities by defining them in the activity tree 
        (via the content package manifest). All objectives defined for an activity 
        (explicitly or by default) are local to the activity. This means that 
        the activity is aware they exist and only that activity&rsquo;s SCO can 
        affect them.</p>
      <p>A local activity can be defined as a "global" objective. This global 
        objective then can be shared with other learning activities. If an objective 
        is declared to be global (via XML in the content package manifest), then 
        the tracking model elements associated with the objective are available 
        to other learning activities that share that same "global" objective.</p>

    <div class="content"> 
      <h2>Objective Mapping</h2>
      <p>Objective maps need to be defined in order to share objective status 
        information between activities. For any defined objective, on any activity, 
        any number of objective maps can be defined. Objective maps can &ldquo;read&rdquo; 
        and/or &ldquo;write&rdquo; local objective status &ldquo;from&rdquo; and 
        &ldquo;to&rdquo; a global objective.</p>

      <h2>Objective Mapping</h2>
      <p>The ID of a global objective defines a set of managed objective information, 
        the same fields used for local objectives. A sequencing implementation 
        will manage these sets of objective information across activities and 
        across a course for a learner, using the ID to reference state. There 
        is no defined naming convention for global objectives, but they should 
        be unique. SCORM does not define a standard unique naming scheme.</p>

      <p>If a &ldquo;read&rdquo; objective map is defined on a local objective 
        and the referenced global objective has a known status, then the global 
        objective status is always utilized for sequencing and rollup rule evaluations. 
        If a &ldquo;read&rdquo; objective map is defined and the global objective 
        has an unknown status, then the local status is utilized for sequencing 
        and rollup rule evaluations. &ldquo;Reading&rdquo; the status from a global 
        objective does not change the local objective state.</p>

      <p>If a &ldquo;write&rdquo; objective map is defined, then the local objective 
        status will be copied to the associated global objectives each time an 
        attempt on the activity ends. For example, if the SCO says &ldquo;passed&rdquo; 
        and the primary objective is &ldquo;written&rdquo; to objective &ldquo;X&rdquo;, 
        objective &ldquo;X&rdquo; will become &ldquo;<code>satisfied</code>&rdquo; when the
